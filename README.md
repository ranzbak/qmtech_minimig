# Open Adaptive Amiga Retro System (Open AARS)

This PCB has been designed for my project in order to run the Minimig Amiga core on a board of my own design.
The core FPGA board I bought of Aliexpress, because soldering the very fine pitched BGA socket is too cumbersome.

More detailed documents regarding the I/O board can be found in the docs directory in this repository.

A Minimig AGA port for this board: [MinimigAGA_TC64](https://github.com/ranzbak/MinimigAGA_TC64/tree/phdev)
The ported version for Open AARS board can be found in the *'phdev'* branch.

## Interfaces provided by this I/O board

- Atari/Amiga compatible Joystick ports
- PS/2 keyboard interface for mouse and keyboard
- Analog audio out, head phone jack using MAX9850 IC
- External floppy interface to connect Amiga floppy drives (Including 12V power pin)
- HDMI display connector video (up to 720p 60Hz)
- 4 status LEDS
- Internal Amiga floppy drive connector
- External Amiga floppy drive connector (DIN-23)
- AS4C16M16SA-6TCN 32Mb SDRAM
- SD-card interface
- RS-232 over USB to program and communicate with the Amiga or Debug
- I2C bus connecting to MAX9850(Audio) and ADV7511 (HDMI transmitter)

## Platforms that _could_ run with this IO board

- Amiga 1200/500(+) - Functional
- Atari ST
- C64
- Other 80's and 90's machines?

Keep in mind I'm only planning on making an Amiga core for this board, but feel free to contribute other cores.
